# Decision-Review-System
Many of us known with a game of Cricket, so I do. There are many crucial moments in cricket and one of them is "RUN OUT" which is detected by third umpire with the help of D.R.S.(Decision Review System) to check that the player is out or not.

# How to Use
I have put all the images in 'photos' folder used in the Code of DRS and link the clip that is used in the code to detect the run out, aditionally put some more clips of run out to check in the 'Clips' folder. Feel free to clone the project and run the program 'main.py'.Also, do commit changes for better updations.
